			Diet Tips to Cut Approximately 750+ of Calories

1 Use smaller plates 
	
2 Eat slowly 
	It takes approximately 20 minutes for the brain to register and send signals that you are full.
	People who eat faster tend to overeat. The people who eat slowly give ample time to the brain to
	understand and send out signals of being full, and they would end up eating less. 

3 Serve a quarter of what you can eat
	We are used to serving ourselves by filling our plates, but,
	we need to be mindful of the serving size. Eating smaller portions is what we require. 

4 Add protein to every meal
	Diet lacking in protein might make you crave more snacks in no time.
	Also, it leads to overeating. Therefore, it is vital to include protein in every meal,
	especially the main meals, breakfast, lunch and dinner.

5 Learn to read food labels 
	If you go for convenience food or packaged food items due to the unavailability of cooked or
	fresh food, learn to read and understand the ingredients

6 Opt for good fats
	Fats are as necessary as proteins and carbs.
	Eating fewer fats would help you in your journey to cut down on extra calories,
	unlike the other two. Choose nuts of your choice over chocolate, as they are high in minerals.
	They will also help reduce sugar cravings. 

7 Get enough sleep
	Apart from the balanced nutrition, you need to get yourself enough rest to
	cut down on hundreds of calories. Lack of sleep makes you crave sugary and fatty foods.
